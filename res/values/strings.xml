   	<string name="about_text">Unix fortune is a simple program that displays a random 
   	 message from a database of quotations that first appeared 
   	 in Version 7 Unix. The most common version 
   	 is the BSD fortune, originally written by Ken Arnold. 
   	 Distributions of fortune are usually bundled with a collection 
   	 of themed files, containing sayings like those found on fortune 
   	 cookies, quotations from famous people, jokes, 
   	 or poetry.
\n\nThis version of Unix fortune was implemented by John Selmys
at Seneca College in Toronto - 2011.
