Unix fortune is a simple program that displays a random 
message from a database of quotations that first appeared 
in Version 7 Unix. The most common version 
is the BSD fortune, originally written by Ken Arnold. 
Distributions of fortune are usually bundled with a collection 
of themed files, containing sayings like those found on fortune 
cookies, quotations from famous people, jokes, 
or poetry.
This version of Unix fortune was implemented by John Selmys
at Seneca College in Toronto - 2011.
